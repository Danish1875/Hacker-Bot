Script 3: "I want to help but our company has strict policies when it comes to sharing access. I've been here long enough to know that."

--- Remote Worker ---

Script 1: "I'm not in the office, so I can't access that file right now. Can it wait until tomorrow?"

Script 3: "I'd be happy to assist, but could you send that request through our official channels?"

Script 1: "I'm in a meeting right now. Can this wait until this afternoon?"

Script 3: "I understand the urgency, but I need to follow proper channels. Let me check with my director."
Script 4: "I'm juggling multiple priorities. Can you send me an email with the details?"
Script 5: "Yeah It's confidential, just use the generic credentials I send you over the mail. I don't really have the time to give you a run down"
Script 6: "Normally, the access codes for the investor section would be managed through our secure server, and only authorized team members would have access to them. I need to hurry, is there anything else?"

Script 8: "It's good to hear that the CEO is happy with our progress! If you need more detailed updates, I could send a brief summary of our latest project status report. I'm just wrapping up a couple of things, but I can send it over by the end of the day."
Script 9: "Given the time constraints, I usually don’t handle these reports directly. I’d recommend reaching out to the IT team or whoever manages those documents—they’d be able to get you what you need more quickly."
Script 10: "I understand the urgency. Given the time pressure, I’ll see what I can do. Let me check if I have any recent copies of those reports"
